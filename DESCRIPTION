Package: spectralGraphTopology
Title: Learning Graphs from Data via Spectral Constraints
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Block coordinate descent estimators to learn k-component, bipartite,
    and k-component bipartite graphs from data by imposing spectral constraints
    on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian and adjacency matrices.
    Those estimators leverages spectral properties of the graphical models as a
    prior information, which turn out to play key roles in unsupervised machine
    learning tasks such as clustering and community detection.
